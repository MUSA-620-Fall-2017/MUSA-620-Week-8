## Assignment

This assignment is not required. You may turn it in by email (galkamaxd at gmail) or in person at class.

**Due:** 22-Mar


### Task:

Choose 3 major brands that have an active presence on Twitter (e.g. Coca Cola, McDonald's, Apple, etc) and compare the sentiment of tweets that mentioning them. The sample size for each should be at least 1,000.

To collect the tweets, you may use either the Twitter streaming or rest API, searching for the brand's Twitter handle as a keyword (e.g. "@CocaCola"). Retweets of the brand should be excluded from the analysis (any tweet containing "rt" in the text)


### Deliverable:

The final results and all code used.
